# Logging:

Levels of Log Message-

1) Debug : These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
2) Info : These are used to Confirm that things are working as expected.
3) Warning : These are used an indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future.
4) Error : This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
5) Critical : This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

If required, developers have the option to create more levels but these are sufficient enough to handle every possible situation.
Each built-in level has been assigned its numeric value.

# HTTP Methods:
  REST APIs listen for HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE to know which operations to perform
on the web serviceâ€™s resources. A resource is any data available in the web service that can be
accessed and manipulated with HTTP requests to the REST API. The HTTP method tells the API which
action to perform on the resource.

      the five methods listed below are the most commonly used with REST APIs:
  
HTTP method     |    Description
----------------|-----------------------------------------
GET         	|  Retrieve an existing resource.
POST	        |  Create a new resource.
PUT	        |  Update an existing resource.
PATCH           |  Partially update an existing resource.
DELETE          |  Delete a resource.
----------------------------------------------------------
              


      Below is a list of the most common status codes returned by REST APIs:

   Code	  |   Meaning    	        |           Description
